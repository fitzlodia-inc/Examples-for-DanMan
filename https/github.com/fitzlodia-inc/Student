//Java program
//note for Dan: Java is a very literal language so its more verbose than python. it's a positive because it compiles quickly 
//but it sucks because there's a lot more keywords (i.e. 'public' and 'private', referring to the scope of the variables)
//and it does not inherently know what type of variable you are creating hence the 'String' and 'double' keywords before the
//variables...also since it doesn't use 'white space' like python, you have to specify your blocks with {} and 
//end lines with semi-colons...total buzzkill


//Student constructor - goes along with the 'test file' which will create an instantiation of the object
public class Student {

	//instance variables
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	double gpa;
	
	//constructor - note that the name of the constructor matches the file/class name
	public Student ( String fName, String lName, double gradePointAvg) {  //these variables exist only as parameters for the arguments they will take
		firstName = fName; //telling the constructor that these arguments will be assigned to the instance variables
		lastName = lName;
		gpa = gradePointAvg;
	} // end constructor 
	
	//now the rest are methods which will be able to be used for each instance of an object the constructor creates
	// note that 'return' keyword indicates that the method will be accessing a stored variable (this still continues to 
	// baffle me at times)
	
	//set first name
	public void SetFirstName ( String fName ) {
		firstName = fName;
	}//end setFirstName
	public String GetFirstName () {
		return firstName ;	
	} //end getFirstName
	public void SetLastName ( String lName ) {
		lastName = lName;
	}// end SetLastName
	public String GetLastName () {
		return lastName;
	}// end GetLastName
	public void SetGPA ( double gradePointAvg ) {
		gpa = gradePointAvg;
	}//end SetGPA 
	public double GetGPA () {
		return gpa;
	}//end GetGPA
	public void IncreaseGPA ( double percentage ) {
		gpa = gpa * (1+(percentage/100));
	}//end IncreaseGPA function - parameter takes whole number percent
	 
} //end class
